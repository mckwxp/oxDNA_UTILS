   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

modify_topology
=======================================

You can download the script `here <https://github.com/mckwxp/oxDNA_UTILS/tree/master/new_scripts>`_.

Primarily used for changing sequences to poly-T in an origami and prints out the new topology file. 
Can also be used to change sequences for other parts, but set_seq scripts should be better.

Usage:

.. code:: python

   python modify_topology.py conf_file top_file virt2nuc seq_file

Args:
    - conf_file: configuration file
    - top_file: topology file
    - virt2nuc: virt2nuc file (can be generated from cadnano_interface.py with a cadnano json file)
    - seq_file: file containing which base to change (details described below)

Notes:
    An example ligate_file is shown below:

    T: 0-25,70-71,stap 0-6,296-297,stap 8-23,392-393,stap 24-25,232-233,stap

    This will change all the nucleotides for the specified (vh, vb, type) to T.
